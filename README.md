This is a simple Android-based typing game developed by me.

It's a single player game. The goal is to correctly type the word shown and score points which in turn reduce the length of the Progress Bar.

The app was created using Java and xml on Java N-IDE(an Android IDE).

The code is currently not on public domain, but incase of any enquiry, I can be reach on
